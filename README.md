# Unveiling-AI-Generated-Content



 This repository explores the differences between AI-generated text and human-generated text using datasets sourced from Kaggle and a BERT-based model for text generation.

## Overview

- **Datasets:** The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at [AI Vs Human Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text). This dataset contains examples of both AI-generated and human-generated text, providing a valuable resource for comparing and analyzing the differences between the two.

- **Model:** The text generation in this project is powered by the `bert-base-multilingual-cased` model. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model that has shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks.
